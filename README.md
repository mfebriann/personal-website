# Personal Website

This repository contains my personal website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It showcases my profile, experience, featured projects, and a contact section with a clean, animation-rich UI.

## Features

- Dark-mode-ready styling with Tailwind CSS utilities
- Animated interactions powered by Framer Motion
- Dynamic theme cursor glow and smooth mobile navigation
